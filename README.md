# Welcome to Romnext
 I've been working on this for a few months and have tons of games including ones from consoles such as the N64 and SNES
 It's pretty simple and has a UI that only uses CSS to make the background blue. It doesn't look like a game site from the home page but by inputting secret commands; you can access tons of games.
 If you want new games simply open an issue and I'll respond and try to get that game
1v1.lol FINALLY ADDED!
